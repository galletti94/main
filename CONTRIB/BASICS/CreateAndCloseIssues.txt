Creating an issue:

Issues can help indeicate to other team members what jobs still need to be performed to 
continue developing the application. If you don't know what you should do to continue
helping with the mobile app, looking at the issues and trying to solve one is a 
great way to contribute

1)	How to create an issue:

2)	On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. (Lance's)

3)	Under your repository name, click Issues.

4)	Click New issue.

5)	Type a title and description for your issue.

6)	When you're finished, click Submit new issue.

How to Close an Issue:

When a pull request or commit references a keyword and issue number, it creates 
an association between the pull request and the issue. When the pull request is 
merged into your repository's default branch, the corresponding issue is 
automatically closed.

The following keywords, followed by an issue number, will close the issue:

close
closes
closed
fix
fixes
fixed
resolve
resolves
resolved

For example, to close an issue numbered 123, you could use the phrases "Closes #123" 
in your pull request description or commit message. Once the branch is merged into 
the default branch, the issue will close.
