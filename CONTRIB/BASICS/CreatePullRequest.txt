Creating the pull request:

If you've forked a repository and made changes to the fork, you can ask that 
the upstream repository accept your changes by creating a pull request.

1)	Navigate to the original repository you created your fork from. (Lance's repositoru)

2)	To the right of the Branch menu, click New pull request.

3)	On the Compare page, click compare across forks.

4)	Confirm that the base fork is the repository you'd like to merge
	changes into. Use the base branch drop-down menu to select the 
	branch of the upstream repository you'd like to merge changes into.

5)	Use the head fork drop-down menu to select your fork, then use the 
	compare branch drop-down menu to select the branch you made your
	changes in.

6)	Type a title and description for your pull request.

7)	If you do not want to allow anyone with push access to the upstream 
	repository to make changes to your PR, unselect Allow edits from 
	maintainers.

8)	Click Create pull request.
